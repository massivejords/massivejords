## Hi, I'm Jordan and I am an aspiring data scientist/computational biologist/bioinformatician! My goal is to help scientific collaborators make the most of their datasets quickly and easily. Check out some of my projects below!

### A. thaliana leaf area detection in OpenCV and PlantCV
I developed a computer vision algorithm using Python to automatically quantify the size leaves grown on agar plates. Below is figure 2 from our paper showing the leaf area detection steps.

*The image-processing steps used for leaf identification. (A) Image converted to black and white using the B channel of the Lab color space. (B) Binary threshold. (C) Region of interest indicated by the blue lines. (D) Identification of individual shoots using clustering and splitting the image into six sections. Note that one seed failed to germinate so no leaf area was measured.*

The software was actually used to collect leaf area for thousands of leaves in [Katz et al 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36130068/) as well!

Check out some real graphs with fake data, all made completely with seaborn and matplotlib.
